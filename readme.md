fPing is a Chrome Extension that removes the [ping](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#ping) attribute from the html page.

The `ping` attribute is used to provide tracking to page owner. Personally, I think it's not anyones business when I click on a link to take me to another site.

This extension simply removes that attribute for safekeeping.
